      Dot-Public aims to address the fact that the internet, as it currently operates, was not designed for civic trust, public service, or democratic resilience.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: 500;">
      Instead, it’s structured around the primarily commercial imperatives of maximising engagement, harvesting data, and monetising attention, which are leading to deep societal harms. These include disinformation, polarisation, erosion of institutional legitimacy, exploitative data practices, and public confusion over what information or services to trust.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: 500;">
      This isn’t merely about online safety. It’s about the weakening of civic infrastructure itself. Citizens, institutions, and democratic systems are co-existing within a digital environment where it’s increasingly difficult to know what’s real, what’s safe, and what’s genuinely public-serving.
