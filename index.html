    <h1>Welcome to Dot-Public2</h1>
    <p>
      Dot-Public is an initiative to create a public-interest digital infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a product.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a permissioned top-level domain – <code>.public</code> – designed to support trust, accountability and civic engagement online.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation is voluntary and permissioned. Institutions that use the Dot-Public domain must adhere to clear governance rules, transparency standards and public service principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are not tracking users or monetising behaviour. They are here to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is simple: to create a trustworthy space online where public institutions and communities can operate with dignity, safety and mutual respect.
